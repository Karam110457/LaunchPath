## **Target audience and mission statement document**

### **Who you’re for**

You’re for **AI-curious beginners** who want to start making money with AI but are stuck in one (or more) of these loops:

* Watching “AI agency” content all day and still not knowing what to do first

* Tool hopping (Make, Zapier, n8n, ChatGPT, agents) without shipping anything real

* Feeling overwhelmed by options: niches, offers, automations, business models

* Wanting speed and results, but not wanting to get scammed or waste months

* Afraid they’ll sell something they can’t deliver because they don’t truly “get” building yet

* Wanting a simple, repeatable path to their **first sellable AI system** and their **first client**

This audience doesn’t need more motivation. They need **direction \+ execution \+ proof**.

---

### **Who you’re not for**

* People who only want “mindset” content and never build

* People looking for a magic button / guaranteed income

* Advanced AI engineers who want deep RAG/LLMOps content

* People who hate outreach and refuse to sell anything (you can’t make money without a buyer)

---

## **Your mission statement**

**My mission is to help AI beginners go from confused → confident by shipping their first simple, sellable AI system — fast.**

I will do this by:

* giving you **one clear direction** instead of 50 options

* turning “ideas” into **blueprints you can actually build**

* showing you **exactly what I’m doing in real time** (wins, mistakes, fixes)

* teaching you how to package what you built into something someone will pay for

* keeping everything beginner-friendly: no jargon, no theory dumps, no fake hype

---

## **Your core promise (what people can expect)**

If you follow what I teach, you’ll leave with:

* a clear “first system” path (niche \+ offer \+ automation)

* a step-by-step build blueprint

* an outreach plan to get your first conversations

* a practical set of templates you can reuse

Not “get rich quick.”  
 **Get competent fast.**

---

## **Your positioning (the difference)**

Most creators sell:

* motivation

* tools lists

* vague “AI agency” advice

* big claims without builds

You teach:

* **what to build first**

* **how to build it**

* **how to sell that specific system**

* with proof shown on screen

Your angle is not “guru.”  
 It’s **builder who’s turning mistakes into shortcuts**.

---

## **Why they should listen to you**

You don’t need to pretend you’ve made £10M to be credible.

They should listen because:

### **1\) You’re a builder, not a commentator**

You ship real systems and show the actual workflow, not just opinions.

### **2\) You’ve already made the beginner mistakes**

You’re not teaching theory. You’re teaching what you wish someone told you.

### **3\) You document reality, not highlight reels**

You show what breaks and how you fix it — which is what beginners actually need to become competent.

### **4\) Your focus is speed with guardrails**

You’re not saying “learn everything.” You’re saying “ship one working system first.”

---

## **Your “north star” message (repeat this everywhere)**

**Stop learning AI. Start shipping one sellable system.**

---

## **Your audience identity (what they become by following you)**

They become:

* a person who can build simple AI systems

* a person who can package and sell one system

* a person who ships instead of consumes

* someone with a repeatable process, not random hacks
