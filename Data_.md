Find prompt for market research that serge gave, agent mode prompt

these are notes that i have, this data is based on serge gatari webinar and is real world data from 200 ai companies in over 70 niches he has partnered with and launched, this will allow the user to actually make money:

he calls it the ai infrastructure playbook

right now there is an ai platform shift

momentum is the key to making money not ai

play the game of business

business momentum \= mass x speed

mass \= pricing power x volume of clients (how much rev per client x how many clients u serve)

speed \= client acquisition rate x fulfilment speed

trend \= multiplier (AI)

SELL TRANSFORMATION, not AI

Delivery needs to be repeatable and scalable 

everyone starts making online businesses without growth systems/infrastructures

no clarity over pipeline or efforts to understand what is working

YOU NEED LEVERAGE \!\!\!

Stop trading time for money

Leverage enginerring

DO NOT COMPETE IN CROWDED MARKETS

Do what the mass is doing and do the opposite within the trend

AI Automation is commodised, All tools are basically free, and the only strategy is to be the cheapest

one video got 1 million views on youtube, why shows people want to start this business a lot and it is very crowded

the problem is everything is so low barrier to entry

focus on small medium sized businesses, 100 employees or less

without the right playbook and process, ai tools are useless

one niche, one vertical, 

focus on understanding the playbook and the skills the 1% of their industry  have that the 99% don't have

The market doesn't reward the best service, it rewards the one that can acquire clients the fastest and most predictable 

Find a niche, go find the problems that that niche is facing, find the edge over the industry 

find a strategic insight in a niche like window cleaning

find the biggest bottleneck so one was talent acquisition and ramp up, this was consistent with two thought leaders, one was recurring residential 

The how to solve \-\> leverage cleaners to fufil for a percentage of the fee and run the business remotely (contractors, insight)

 insight 4 lead gen (google service ads)

gather all insights, problems, solutions 

then based on that insight write it down, why is it worth the attention and then the impact

How can we leverage that insight to gain an edge (framework, system, mechanism) and what would be the outcome of this application 

go through this insight breakdown and application of insight for niche

then come up with other problems that the niche would face when they scale

so window cleaners, need leadflow, close leads, appts booked, appts shown up, higher pricing so it can be more profitable, talent to scale and fufill, customer service, retention model (lack of), supplies and equipment, tech management, lack of differentiation, 

then find the solutions to each one of those, and see how to fufill it like using ai now.

then go look at your niche and then different market segments of that niche

so for window cleaner, maybe beginners, 5k \- 10k, 10k \- 30k, 30k-50k, 50k+

then understand which segment of the market will:

\- get biggest roi from service  
\- afford it effortlessly  
\- almost guarantee results and success  
\- easily find them

then overall score each has 25% weight

find the sweet spot of the niche

now based on the mechanism to solve those insights or problems, come up with a priority list, time and resource constraint

now we need to understand the impact level and the ease level to understand what to prioritise.

so we do a value prop in your build and release business model

their current position to their desired situation

Offer \- positioning \- segment \- pricing

you need to find recurring needs

then find recurring revenue opportunities 

data on best performing lead gen campaigns, dfy lead gen, talent 

they would never get rid of you

You need to cover the whole sales pipeline and beyond

be insightful, understand their business inside and out

Build client acquisition for their services

think 10 steps ahead

sell a to b first and then if you achieve growth then offer retention 

you need to think about your guarantee,

how to communicate your offer (landing page vsl structure)

how will you get your leads, appointments, closing? (you need infrastructure)

ads \-\> vsl \-\> setter?

ease of implementation

every single point where people are lazy or friction, build infrastructure/systems

build and release model (build one, release to many)

do a monthly fee or % of growth 

then in the future private equity or saas, owning the business you scale

all returns in life are from compound interest 

people don't buy from companies but from people

You need to generate attention, paid ads, ai faceless content to ur niche, ai voice, content based on what is going  on in that niche 

the best businesses are the ones that can get leads, have good systems to nurture, educate

re engage old leads or lead that already opted in, you do not always need new leads as this can make u go bankrupt (for your business and clients)

free trial to gain trust before testimonials

convert skills into ai frameworks

do not forget about people that were on sales calls and people you did not close, you can turn non buyers into buyers (for your business and clients)

(lead and non buyer reactivation)

inversion objection technique, turn hesitiations into powerful reasons to work with you

you have to make what your doing sound new and different

role play demo of ai is best for selling

go deeper into vertical as open ai will not do this and you have longevity, and cant be taken out
