# LaunchPath: Tracking & Attribution System

## The Core Problem We're Solving

Users send 25 messages with demo links and have no idea:
- Which message actually worked
- Who viewed the demo
- Who filled out the form
- Which prospects are hot vs cold
- What led to closed deals

**Result:** They're flying blind. Can't optimize. Can't prove ROI. Can't scale what works.

---

## The Solution: Full Attribution Intelligence

Every demo URL is uniquely tracked. Every action is logged. Every conversion is attributed back to the source.

**You'll know exactly:**
- Which message got clicked
- Which prospect viewed the demo
- How long they spent on it
- What they did on the page
- Whether they filled the form
- If they shared it with colleagues
- Which ones turned into clients
- What revenue came from which message

---

## How It Works

### 1. Unique Tracking URLs

**Instead of:**
```
All 25 prospects get: demo.launchpath.ai/john/roofing
```

**You generate:**
```
Message #1 (Mike @ ABC Roofing):
demo.launchpath.ai/john/roofing?prospect_id=abc_001&message=07

Message #2 (Sarah @ Crystal Clear):
demo.launchpath.ai/john/roofing?prospect_id=crystal_002&message=07

... 25 unique URLs
```

**Every URL tells you exactly who clicked it.**

---

### 2. What Gets Tracked

When anyone clicks a demo URL, you capture:

**Basic:**
- Who clicked (prospect ID)
- When they clicked (timestamp)
- Which message they came from
- Which channel (LinkedIn, email, etc.)

**Behavioral:**
- How long they stayed (30 sec vs 4 minutes)
- What sections they viewed
- Did they fill the form?
- Did they click "Book a call"?
- Did they bounce immediately?

**Viral:**
- Did they share it with colleagues?
- How many people from same company viewed?
- Is this an internal buying committee?

---

### 3. Lead Capture Dashboard

Every demo form submission shows up in your dashboard:

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Leads (8 new)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

```

**You see everyone who engaged, not just who replied.**

---

### 4. Behavior-Based Lead Scoring

Not all form fills are equal. We score based on buying signals:

**High Score (90-100) = Extremely Hot:**
- Spent 4+ minutes on demo
- Filled entire form (not just email)
- Clicked pricing section
- Clicked "Book a call" button
- Shared with colleagues
- Returned to view again
- Viewed during business hours

**Medium Score (60-89) = Warm:**
- Spent 1-3 minutes
- Filled form partially
- Viewed on mobile
- Single view
- Weekend browsing

**Low Score (0-59) = Cold:**
- Bounced in under 30 seconds
- Incomplete form
- No engagement signals

**Focus your time on the 90+ scores. They convert at 70%+ rates.**

---

### 5. Real-Time Engagement Alerts

Get notified the moment someone is viewing your demo:

```
🔴 LIVE NOW

Mike Johnson is viewing your demo RIGHT NOW

Viewing: 2 min 14 sec (active)
Currently on: Pricing section
Actions: ✓ Filled form, ✓ Clicked CTA

[Send message now] [Call him] [Watch session]

Suggested message:
"Hey Mike, saw you just checked out the demo - 
questions about pricing?"
```

**Strike while the iron is hot. Message them within minutes of viewing.**

---

### 6. Viral Sharing Detection

When prospects share your demo internally:

```
⚠️ VIRAL SHARING DETECTED

ABC Roofing: 3 people viewed your demo

Original recipient: Mike Johnson
Also viewed by: 2 colleagues (same company IP)

This is a BUYING COMMITTEE signal.

Suggested action:
Call Mike and ask: "Saw a couple people from your 
team checked it out - should I loop anyone else into 
our conversation?"
```

**This is gold. Multiple viewers = serious interest.**

---

### 7. Message Performance Analytics

See which messages actually work:

```

### 10. Performance Benchmarking

Compare your results to others in your niche:

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Reply rate:
You: 16% | Average: 12% | Top 10%: 22%
✓ You're beating average by 33%

Demo conversion:
You: 44% | Average: 38% | Top 10%: 58%
✓ You're above average

Close rate:
You: 28% | Average: 22% | Top 10%: 45%
✓ You're doing well, room to improve

Time to close:

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

(top performers respond 3x faster than average)
```

**Know where you stand. Learn from top performers.**

## The Bottom Line

**Without tracking:**
"I sent some messages and got a client somehow"

**With tracking:**
"Message #7 with the contractor scaling hook gets 18% reply rate, 44% demo conversion, and 60% close rate. It generated $54,000 in annual revenue from 3 closed deals in 10 days. I'm using that pattern for my next batch."

**That's the difference between guessing and knowing.**

**That's the difference between random success and repeatable revenue.**

**That's what makes LaunchPath world-class.**
