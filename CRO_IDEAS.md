# CRO Experiment Ideas (What to test next)

## 1. Headline Testing
- **Current**: "Stop learning AI. Start shipping." (Direct, negative hook)
- **Variant A**: "Build your first sellable AI offer in 7 days." (Outcome focused)
- **Variant B**: "The only AI course that forces you to build." (Comparison focused)

## 2. Social Proof Placement
- **Current**: "Join 2,000+ builders" text under form.
- **Test**: Move social proof *above* the headline (e.g., "Trusted by builders from X, Y, Z").
- **Test**: Add a "Wall of Love" section (scrolling tweets/testimonials) between Problem and Solution.

## 3. CTA Button
- **Current**: "Join ->" (White button, black text)
- **Test**: "Get Early Access" (More exclusive)
- **Test**: "Start Building" (Action oriented)
- **Test**: Emerald/Accent color button instead of White.

## 4. "The Loop" Visualization
- **Current**: 3 cards (Tutorial Hell, Tool Hopping, Analysis Paralysis).
- **Test**: A visual diagram/flowchart showing the loop vs. the straight line of LaunchPath.

## 5. Lead Magnet
- **Current**: Waitlist access.
- **Test**: "Join waitlist and get the '7-Day Build Checklist' PDF instantly." (Instant gratification).
